                            Joined Castle Ventures as an intern in 2019, and assisted with various programming and research projects, 
                            including the development of Powershell and Python-based tools to automate and enhance AWS functionality.

                            Developed tools to integrate open-source intelligence information with SIEM alerting, enabling the 
                            correlation of threats and system events.  In addition, I developed other tools to identify and fix broken 
                            links in millions of Office 365 files to facilitate server migrations, as well as creating a package of 
                            scripts used by clients to monitor and alert on events in their enterprise.
